      <h4>Hi! I'm Sneha Poojary,
         a passionate and driven full-stack developer with a love for building intelligent, impactful digital solutions. 
         I specialize in working with modern technologies like React, Node.js, FastAPI, and MongoDB,
          and I'm deeply enthusiastic about exploring emerging fields like AI/ML, Blockchain, and Computer Vision (YOLO, NLP).
<br></br><br></br>
I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly experiences  whether it's developing a personalized health assistant, an AI-powered travel planner, or smart hygiene monitoring systems using YOLO and DAO. From frontend design with Tailwind CSS to backend logic with Express.js and FastAPI, I love being involved in every step of the development process.
<br></br><br></br>
I'm constantly pushing myself through hackathons, open-source contributions, and real-world projects. I believe in the power of tech to solve real-world problems and strive to build products that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and user-centric.
<br></br><br></br>
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading about startups, experimenting with new APIs, or planning something exciting for my next project.
<br></br><br></br>
 Outside of tech, I enjoy reading novels, listening to music, and spending time gardening they help me unwind and recharge my creativity.</h4>

      <h1>I’m always open to learning, collaborating, or just having a good tech chat!</h1>
